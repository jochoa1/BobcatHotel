# BobcatHotel
One of my first academic projects in college written in Java. 
The purpose of this program is to simulate an interaction between a hotel customer and computer. The user is able to book a room at the Bobcat Hotel being able to choose from a number of listed options and inputting their own parameters to calculate the overall cost of their stay.
